- A doubly linked list is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes, where each node contains a data element and two pointers, one pointing to the previous node and one pointing to the next node. This structure allows traversal in both forward and backward directions, providing efficient insertion and deletion operations at both ends of the list. Unlike singly linked lists, doubly linked lists offer bidirectional traversal, making them useful for scenarios requiring frequent insertion and deletion operations in various positions within the list. However, they require more memory due to the additional pointer for each node. Doubly linked lists are commonly used in scenarios where efficient traversal and modification of data in both directions are required, such as implementing caches, undo functionality in text editors, and managing browser history.
