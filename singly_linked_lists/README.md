- A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science used to store a collection of elements. Unlike arrays, where elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, linked lists consist of nodes where each node contains a data element and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations, as elements can be easily added or removed without the need to shift other elements. Linked lists come in various forms, such as singly linked lists, where each node points to the next node, and doubly linked lists, where each node also has a reference to the previous node. Linked lists are widely used in implementing other data structures and algorithms, such as stacks, queues, and hash tables, making them a fundamental concept in computer science education and software development.
