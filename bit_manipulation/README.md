Bitwise operators are fundamental tools in computer programming for manipulating individual bits within binary data. These operators perform operations at the binary level, allowing programmers to control the behavior of data on a fine-grained scale. The main bitwise operators include AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), and shift operators (<< and >>). By applying these operators to binary numbers, programmers can perform tasks such as setting or clearing specific bits, combining or separating data, and optimizing memory usage. Understanding bitwise operators is crucial for tasks such as low-level programming, cryptography, and embedded systems development, where efficiency and precise control over data representation are essential.
